                        <p>From the 25th of october to the 5th of november, our school had two weeks of work placement.</p>
                        <p>Businesses took in students from schools around the municipality that would "work" for them for that short period of time.
                            They bother because they get free work force, and we bother because it gives us an idea of how it is to be in a job.</p>
                        <p>Not everyone got a place or wanted one, and those who didn't stayed at school and had a project there. I got a place at a company who sells and repairs 3D printers called 3DNet, where I repaired and upgraded printers at a workshop, as well as doing inventory.</p>

                        <p>Though 3DNet is the biggest 3D company in Norway, they only have five employees who do the practical work, and six who do admin, accounting, etc.
                           Additionally, there was one trainee who has worked there for 1 and a half years, and me. 
                        </p>
                        <p>As a result of so few people working there, it was extra important that everyone took part and were proactive, and there was good communication and teamwork between everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>That being said, I was surprised about the informal language everone spoke with. Though it was to the point, the use of language was rather unserious.
                           Aditionally, people were quite self-driven about their work, there was no one who went around and told people what to do.
                           One might take a spontaneous brake any time, as long as they went beck to work later. You could sort of do what you wanted, as long as it was more or less work-related
                           (like when one of the employees asked me to fix his electrical scooter. I was also supposedly requested to print an adapter for his brake, so he could put it on the front wheel. For in-door use at slow speeds, of course....)
                        </p>
                        <p>During my period there, i collaborated with the trainee in doing many different tasks. To start off with, I mostly watched and did simpler things under his supervision, like tightening bolts and screwing things in place.
                           However, after some time I was able to do more things by myself.</p>
                        <p>Generally, I couldn't have been more glad to get a job placement at 3DNet.
